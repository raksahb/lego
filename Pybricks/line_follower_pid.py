"""
Advanced Line Following Robot with PID Control + Direction Following
====================================================================

This program combines two approaches for robust line following:
1. Direction-based steering: Uses the line's angle to determine turn direction
2. PID position control: Fine-tunes steering based on line position

Key improvements over simple direction-only control:
- PID helps maintain precise positioning on the line
- Direction provides natural curve anticipation
- Adaptive speed control for different curve types

PID Control Concepts:
- P (Proportional): Responds to current position error
- I (Integral): Responds to accumulated position error over time
- D (Derivative): Responds to rate of position error change

This provides the best of both worlds: intuitive direction following
with precise position control.
